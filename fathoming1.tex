Katta G. Murty Lecture slides

Assume original problem minimization problem. Let K0 = its set of feasible solutions.

During B&B K0 is partitioned into many simpler subsets, each
subset is set of feasible sols. of a problem called a Candidate Problem or CP.

Each CP is the original problem, augmented with additional
constraints called Branching Constraints.

Branching constraints are simple constraints generated by an
operation called Branching.

Whenever a new CP is generated, an LB = Lower Bound for min. obj. value in it is computed by a procedure called Lower bounding strategy

For some CPs, the LB strategy may actually produce a minimum cost feasible sol. in it. In this case, that CP is said to be fathomed, it need not be processed any further, so is taken out
from further consideration.

Among the optimum solutions of fathomed CPs, the best is called the incumbent at this stage, and it is stored and updated.
So, the objective value of incumbent is an Upper Bound for the min obj. value in original problem.

The incumbent and upper bound change whenever a new and
better feasible sol. appears in method due to fathoming.

In each stage, method selects one CP to examine, called Current
CP.
• If LB for current CP ≥ current Upper Bound, this CP is
Pruned, i.e., discarded. The Partial enumeration property
of method comes from this.
• Otherwise, set of feasible solutions of this CP is partitioned
into 2 or more subsets by applying branching strategy on it.

Main Steps in B&B
Bounding: B&B uses both :
Upper Bound for min objective value in original
problem: Changes whenever incumbent does, and decreases
when it changes.
Lower Bound for min obj. value in each CP: Caluculated
by applying LB strategy on it.
Pruning: Deleting some CPs from further consideration. A
CP is pruned
• if its LB ≥ Current UB
• if it is fathomedif it is found infeasible
Branching: This operation on a CP (Called Parent Node,
generates two or more new CPs (called its Children).

The various steps:
The LB strategy: Most commonly used LB strategy is based
on solving a relaxed problem.
To find LB for a CP, this strategy relaxes (i.e., ignores) difficult
constraints in it until remaining problem can be solved by an
efficient algo. Opt. sol. of relaxed problem called Relaxed
Optimum. Objective value of relaxed opt. is a LB for the CP.
Fathoming Criterion: If relaxed opt. satisfies the relaxed
constraints,it is in fact an opt. sol. for that CP, in this case
the CP is Fathomed. Thus lower bounding based on relaxation
lends itself very easily to fathoming.

Quality of Lower Bounds: The higher the quality of LB
(i.e., higher it is, or closer it is to the min obj. value) the more
pruning, thus reducing no. of CPs algo. has to examine. In designing
an LB strategy, need strike a balance between: (1) Quality
of LB (Higher the better), and (2) Computational effort needed
to get it (Smaller the better).
