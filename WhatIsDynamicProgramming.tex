Dynamic Programming (also known as dynamic optimization) is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions.

Dynamic Programming is a powerful technique that allows one to solve many different types of
problems in time O(n2) or O(n3) for which a naive approach would take exponential time. 

Dynamic Programmingis a general approach to solving problems, much like “divide-and-conquer” is a general
method, except that unlike divide-and-conquer, the subproblems will typically overlap.
