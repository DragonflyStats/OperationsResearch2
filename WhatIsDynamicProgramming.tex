Dynamic Programming (also known as dynamic optimization) is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions.



Dynamic Programmingis a general approach to solving problems, much like “divide-and-conquer” is a general
method, except that unlike divide-and-conquer, the subproblems will typically overlap.
