 \section*{Introduction to Linear Programming}
 	\subsection*{Question 1.} Each gadget requires 4 hours in the cutting department, while
 	each widget requires 5 hours in the same department. If the
 	cutting department has at most 80 hours available, write the linear inequality
 	that expresses the relationship between the number of gadgets x, and the number
 	of widgets y produced.
 	
 	\subsection*{Question 2.}  Find all the vertex point(s) of the system
 	\begin{eqnarray*}
 	x + 2y \leq 480 \\
 	3x + 4y \leq 1080 \\
 	x \geq 60 \\
 	y \geq 30
 	\end{eqnarray*}
 
 \subsection*{Question 3.}  Maximise P = 5x + 4y subject to the constraints
 \begin{eqnarray*}3x + 4y \leq 24 \\
 2x + y \leq 14 \\
 x \geq 0 \\
 y \geq 0 \end{eqnarray*}
