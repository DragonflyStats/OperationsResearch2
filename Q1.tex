O'Brien Kinsella Burke Investments is considering investments into 5 projects: A, B, C, D, and E.

Each project has an initial cost, an expected profit rate (one year from now) expressed as a
percentage of the initial cost, and an associated risk of failure.
These numbers are given in the table below:
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
	\hline  & A & B & C & D & E \\ 
	\hline Initial Cost & 1.5 & 0.9 & 0.7 & 1.5 & 2.1 \\ 
	\hline Profit Rate & 10\% & 15\% & 10\% & 12\% & 10\% \\ 
		\hline Failure Risk & 6\% & 4\% & 6\% & 5\% & 4\%  \\ 
	\hline 
\end{tabular} 
a) Provide a formulation to choose the projects that maximize total expected profit, such that
Merrill Lynch does not invest more than 5M dollars and its average failure risk is not over
5%.

For example, if Merrill Lynch invests only into A and B, it invests only 2.5M dollars and its
average failure risk is (6%+4%)/2=5%.
b) Suppose that if A is chosen, B must be chosen. Modify your formulation.
c) Suppose that if C is chosen, E must not be chose
c) Suppose that if A and C are chosen, D must be chosen. Modify your formulation.
d) Suppose
